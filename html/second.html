    <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you
        a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
        of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those
        who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is
        there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
        circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which
        of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
        to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
        that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
